We loved NanocANDy's idea to put their original lab book online. Not only does it convey scientific integrity, it also shows just how difficult and (occasionally) futile avenues of scientific investigation can be. 

We hope that others struggling in their own projects will be spurred on by seeing both our successes and our failures. Science is never plain sailing, but we're going to do our best anyway!
